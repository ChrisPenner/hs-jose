# jose - Javascript Object Signing and Encryption & JWT (JSON Web Token)

jose is a Haskell implementation of [Javascript Object Signing and
Encryption](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/) and [JSON Web
Token]
(https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token/).

Encryption (JWE) is not supported but signing is supported.  All key
types and algorithms are supported, but EC and symmetric key
generation is not yet implemented.

Contributions are welcome.
